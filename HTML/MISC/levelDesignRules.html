            If the player thinks they should be able to reach an area. They should be able to reach it.
            <li>
                Surround the outer limits of your map with enclosed rooms, towering cliffs, or deep abysses. You can still make these visually interesting, but there should be a clear delineation between accessable areas and inaccessable ones.

                The purpose of invisible walls is to make sure the player doesn't get stuck on jagged bits of scenery. They should NOT be used to block off portions of the map that otherwise look reachable, except perhaps in very high places, where there is some variation in the height of surrounding rooftops, for example.
