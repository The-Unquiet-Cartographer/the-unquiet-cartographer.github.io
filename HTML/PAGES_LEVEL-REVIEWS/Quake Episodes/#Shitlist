AKA Was either too hard or too shit and I probably won't play again.



Warpspasm
• Jesus Christ where do I even start?
• Enemies spawn behind you constantly to the point where it's predictable.
• I barely had enough ammo most of the time, and no ammo the rest of the time. I had to melee a Vore FFS.
• It got to the point where I just started running past the enemies, because it was less tedious than actually fighting them.
• No-one has ever thought the Spore was a good enemy, EVER.
• A thoroughly unenjoyable experience.
