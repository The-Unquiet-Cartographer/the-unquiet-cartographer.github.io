    <h3>Criteria</h3>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Layout</th>
            <td>Essentially the floorplan and sightlines, but also meta aspects like combat hotspots and balance of power between positions.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Construction</th>
            <td>How does the level geometry prop up (or hinder) the ideas and gameplay in the level? Bad geometry can ruin a good layout.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Aesthetics</th>
            <td>Textures, lighting, atmosphere, sound, setting. The look and the feel of the map.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Entities</th>
            <td>How well are entities and dynamic props used? Can be anything from weapon and player spawns, to physics objects, to bounce pads and teleporters.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Aggregate</th>
            <td>Mean average of the previous four categories.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Personal</th>
            <td>How I feel about the map, sans criteria.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <h3>Ratings</h3>
    <p>These are rule-of-thumb definitions. Levels often contain good and bad aspects which must be weighed up when assigning scores. Even the most inexperienced mapper can have great ideas.
